# ✅ Redux ToDo Checkpoint

## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple and responsive **ToDo Application** built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit**. It was developed as part of a checkpoint assessment to demonstrate knowledge in:

- Creating and structuring reusable React components
- Managing global state with Redux Toolkit
- Implementing user interactions: **Add**, **Filter**, and **Edit** tasks

Each task contains a unique `id`, a `description`, and a `status` indicating whether it is completed (`isDone`).

### 🧩 Features

- ➕ Add a new task
- ✅ Mark tasks as done or not done
- 🔍 Filter tasks by status (All, Done, Not Done)
- ✏️ Edit an existing task
- 💾 Global state managed via **Redux Toolkit**

### 🗂️ Components Structure

- `AddTask`: Handles user input to create new tasks
- `ListTask`: Displays and filters tasks
- `Task`: Represents each individual task with editing and status toggling

## 🧠 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Redux Toolkit simplifies state management in a React app, especially in cases that require global data sharing and updates like a ToDo list. It was a great hands-on experience that reinforced my understanding of React-Redux integration, component structure, and user interactivity.
